        <h3 id="headline"> Lyrics that will make you hype </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1. "If they build a wall, let's jump a fence, I'm over this"</strong>.Paak has criticized social and political trends as of late, especially here on "King James". Gives us a simple way of just jumping over a wall that Trump wants to build.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. "Your mind is a stairway, knock on Heaven's door"</strong>Song: "Twilight". Andy references not one, but TWO classic rock songs that are still celebrated today, "Stairway to Heaven" and "Knockin' On Heaven's Door"...what can't this man do? 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3. "I'm so gone, so far, I deserve more"</strong>Song: "Come Home (feat. Andre 3000)". Although a very simple lyric, it seems as though .Paak is still reaching for the skies and leaving people (a lover?) behind. Andre 3000's verse is great, too.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4. "When you take somebody for your own/It can't survive on history alone"</strong> Wow. What a freakin' lyric talking about how relationships should never be based on their history or the good times they USED to share, but for the evolution of their relationship and continue to love each other.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>5. "It's the rap singer, the hook master"</strong> - On the final song "What Can We Do?", .Paak enlists Nate Dogg (perhaps from an old session or throwaway verse he recorded before he passed) and shouts him out in the first line. What a tribute.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>6. "You're sniffin' too much, baby, I had to (Hide my yay')"</strong>Song: "Reachin' 2 Much (feat. Lalah Hathaway)". Yay' is slang for cocaine that .Paak calls out since the girl in the song apparently has an addiction. He questions her and what she wants in life that doesn't involve crippling addictions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>7. "This is not some take you out for lunch/Wine and dine you and *cha* you on counter tops"</strong>Song: "Winners Circle". Andy focuses on many of his past relationships into one symbolic lover, mentioning how he doesn't want to just have a one time experience with her (or series of hers lol). Interesting but awesome lyric.
          </li>
        </ul>
